With experience as a Frontend Developer and three years as an IT Support Engineer, my focus has transitioned to IT infrastructure and cloud technologies. Known for a hands-on approach, I have a strong passion for continuous learning and applying new technologies. Currently, I am actively enhancing my skills in Azure and DevOps methodology.
